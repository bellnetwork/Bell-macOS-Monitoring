# Bell System Monitoring for macOS

The Bell macOS Monitoring script is a Python-based monitoring tool designed to collect and report various system metrics from macOS-based servers. It provides functionalities for monitoring system performance, tracking resource usage, checking for updates, and sending alerts. The script is intended to be run as a background service and can be customized to suit specific monitoring needs.

Overview
The script utilizes various Python libraries and system commands to gather information about the system's performance, resource utilization, network activity, and more. It communicates with a remote server to report the collected data, allowing users to monitor their macOS server's health and status remotely.

Features
System Information: The script collects and reports essential system information, including the global IP address, hostname, uptime, and operating system version.

Update Check: The script periodically checks for updates and downloads and installs them if available, ensuring that the monitoring tool is up-to-date.

Resource Monitoring: The script monitors CPU usage, memory usage, disk usage, network bandwidth, and other system resources.

Temperature Monitoring: The script gathers temperature data from system sensors, providing insights into the server's thermal state.

Process Monitoring: It tracks running processes and their CPU usage, allowing users to monitor the performance of individual processes.

Alerting Mechanisms: The script can be configured to send alerts based on predefined thresholds for disk usage, swap usage, and network latency.

Service Status Monitoring: It checks the status of a specific service and can trigger server reboot or shutdown actions based on the server's status.

Usage
Dependencies: The script relies on various Python libraries, including psutil, requests, and others. Make sure these dependencies are installed.

Configuration: Configure the script by modifying the settings at the beginning of the script. Customize alert thresholds, URLs, and other parameters to match your requirements.

Execution: Run the script as a background service. It will continuously gather data and send it to a remote server for monitoring.

Alerts: Configure alerting mechanisms by setting threshold values for resource usage. The script will send alerts if resource usage exceeds the specified thresholds.

Note
The script includes features for handling errors and reporting them to a remote server.
The script is structured with various functions to modularize different monitoring and reporting tasks.
Make sure to replace placeholders like URLs with the actual endpoints you'll be using.
Disclaimer
This script is provided as a starting point for creating a monitoring tool and may require additional adjustments to work seamlessly with your system and network environment. It's important to review and test the script in a controlled environment before deploying it to production systems.

Installation and Usage Guide
Prerequisites
macOS-based server
Python 3.x installed
Internet connectivity
Installation Steps
Clone the Repository: Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to store the monitoring script. Clone the repository using the following command:

git clone gh repo clone bellnetwork/bellsys_moni_macos
  cd bellsys_moni_macos
  Install Dependencies: Install the required Python dependencies using pip:

  pip3 install psutil requests
Configuration: Open the script file (sys_check.py) in a text editor and modify the configuration settings at the beginning of the script. Customize URLs, alert thresholds, and other parameters as needed.

Run the Script: Run the script in the background as a service. You can do this using a terminal command:

  python3 sys_check.py &
This command starts the script in the background. You can exit the terminal, and the script will continue running.

Usage Guide
Monitoring Data: The script will continuously monitor various metrics, such as CPU usage, memory usage, network activity, and more.

Alerts: If configured, the script will send alerts when predefined thresholds are exceeded. Check the configuration settings to customize alert thresholds.

Update Check: The script will periodically check for updates and install them if available. This ensures the monitoring tool is up-to-date.

Remote Monitoring: The collected data is sent to a remote server for monitoring. Configure the URLs in the script to match your remote server's endpoints.

Stopping the Script
To stop the script, you need to find its process ID (PID) and use the kill command. Follow these steps:

Use the following command to list all background processes:

  ps aux | grep sys_check.py
Identify the process ID (PID) of the script.

Use the kill command to stop the script by sending the appropriate signal. Replace <pid> with the actual process ID.

  kill <pid>
Customization and Advanced Usage
You can further customize the script by adding more monitoring functions, modifying alert mechanisms, or integrating additional system metrics.
Modify the script's behavior by adjusting the intervals at which data is collected, alerts are checked, and updates are performed.
Disclaimer
This guide provides a basic overview of installing and using the monitoring script. Additional adjustments may be required to suit your specific environment.
Always test the script in a controlled environment before deploying it to production systems.
Remember that system monitoring and automation tools can have a significant impact on system behavior. Ensure you understand the script's functionality and test it thoroughly before implementing it in a production environment.
