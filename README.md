The Bell macOS Monitoring script is a Python-based monitoring tool designed to collect and report various system metrics from macOS-based servers. It provides functionalities for monitoring system performance, tracking resource usage, checking for updates, and sending alerts. The script is intended to be run as a background service and can be customized to suit specific monitoring needs.

Overview
The script utilizes various Python libraries and system commands to gather information about the system's performance, resource utilization, network activity, and more. It communicates with a remote server to report the collected data, allowing users to monitor their macOS server's health and status remotely.

Features
System Information: The script collects and reports essential system information, including the global IP address, hostname, uptime, and operating system version.

Update Check: The script periodically checks for updates and downloads and installs them if available, ensuring that the monitoring tool is up-to-date.

Resource Monitoring: The script monitors CPU usage, memory usage, disk usage, network bandwidth, and other system resources.

Temperature Monitoring: The script gathers temperature data from system sensors, providing insights into the server's thermal state.

Process Monitoring: It tracks running processes and their CPU usage, allowing users to monitor the performance of individual processes.

Alerting Mechanisms: The script can be configured to send alerts based on predefined thresholds for disk usage, swap usage, and network latency.

Service Status Monitoring: It checks the status of a specific service and can trigger server reboot or shutdown actions based on the server's status.

Usage
Dependencies: The script relies on various Python libraries, including psutil, requests, and others. Make sure these dependencies are installed.

Configuration: Configure the script by modifying the settings at the beginning of the script. Customize alert thresholds, URLs, and other parameters to match your requirements.

Execution: Run the script as a background service. It will continuously gather data and send it to a remote server for monitoring.

Alerts: Configure alerting mechanisms by setting threshold values for resource usage. The script will send alerts if resource usage exceeds the specified thresholds.

Note
The script includes features for handling errors and reporting them to a remote server.
The script is structured with various functions to modularize different monitoring and reporting tasks.
Make sure to replace placeholders like URLs with the actual endpoints you'll be using.
Disclaimer
This script is provided as a starting point for creating a monitoring tool and may require additional adjustments to work seamlessly with your system and network environment. It's important to review and test the script in a controlled environment before deploying it to production systems.
